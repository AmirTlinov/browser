[LEGEND]
PRINCIPLE = A durable rule that trades off local optimization for global clarity.

[CONTENT]
This repo prefers [PRINCIPLE] that optimize for cognitive cheapness ([COGNITIVE_BUDGET|LEGEND.md]):
- Contracts over conventions.
- Deterministic checks over “works on my machine”.
- Summaries by default; [DRILLDOWN|LEGEND.md] when needed.
- Safe defaults at boundaries (network, cookies, dumps).
- Small, reversible changes over heroic refactors.
