[LEGEND]
GOAL = A measurable outcome we optimize for.
NON_GOAL = An explicit thing we are not optimizing for (right now).

[CONTENT]
## [GOAL]
- Provide an AI-native browser control surface ([TOOL|LEGEND.md]) with low [NOISE|LEGEND.md] and strong [COGNITIVE_BUDGET|LEGEND.md].
- Make frontend debugging cheap: fast [TRIAGE|LEGEND.md] → precise drilldowns → actionable next steps.
- Keep the tool contract stable and versionable ([CONTRACT|LEGEND.md]).
- Keep safety visible and enforceable (host allowlist, dumps redaction).

## [NON_GOAL]
- Being a full Playwright/Selenium replacement with every niche feature.
- Shipping a generic “agent framework”. This repo is a tool, not a platform.
